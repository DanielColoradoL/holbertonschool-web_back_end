Introduction
JavaScript provides powerful object-oriented programming features, including classes and metaprogramming capabilities. This README serves as a guide to using classes and exploring metaprogramming techniques in JavaScript.

Defining a Class
In JavaScript, classes are defined using the class keyword followed by the class name. Here's an example of defining a simple class:

javascript
Copy code
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
Adding Methods to a Class
Methods can be added to a class using the class's prototype. Here's an example of adding a method sayHello to the Person class:

javascript
Copy code
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}!`);
  }
}
Static Methods in a Class
Static methods belong to the class itself and are not accessible through instances of the class. They are defined using the static keyword. Here's an example of adding a static method isValidAge to the Person class:

javascript
Copy code
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}!`);
  }

  static isValidAge(age) {
    return age >= 0 && age <= 120;
  }
}
Extending a Class
In JavaScript, classes can be extended from other classes using the extends keyword. This allows for creating subclasses with additional functionality. Here's an example of extending the Person class to create a Student subclass:

javascript
Copy code
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, grade) {
    super(name, age);
    this.grade = grade;
  }

  study() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is studying hard!`);
  }
}
Metaprogramming and Symbols
Metaprogramming in JavaScript involves writing code that manipulates other parts of the program, such as classes, objects, or functions, at runtime. Symbols are unique and immutable data types that can be used as keys for object properties. They are often used in metaprogramming to define unique property keys. Here's a brief example of using symbols:

javascript
Copy code
const mySymbol = Symbol('description');
const obj = {};

obj[mySymbol] = 'value';

console.log(obj[mySymbol]); // Output: 'value'
