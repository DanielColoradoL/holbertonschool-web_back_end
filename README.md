Variable annotations in Python allow you to specify the types of variables within your code. This feature was introduced in Python 3.6 as part of PEP 526. Variable annotations are used to provide hints to developers and tools about the types of values that variables are expected to hold. While Python remains dynamically typed, variable annotations enable static type checkers and IDEs to analyze code more effectively for potential type-related errors and to provide better code completion and documentation assistance. Variable annotations are typically written using the : syntax after the variable name, specifying the type of the variable. For example, x: int = 5 annotates the variable x as an integer with an initial value of 5. These annotations are primarily used for documentation and tooling purposes and do not enforce type checking at runtime by default. However, they can be utilized by external type checkers like MyPy to perform static type analysis on Python code.
