Pagination Readme

Simple Pagination with Page and Page_Size Parameters
Pagination is a technique used to divide a large dataset into smaller, manageable chunks called pages. The simplest form of pagination involves using two parameters:

Page: Specifies the page number you want to retrieve.
Page_Size: Specifies the number of items to display per page.
To paginate a dataset using these parameters, follow these steps:

Determine the total number of items in your dataset.
Calculate the total number of pages based on the total items and page size.
Use the page and page_size parameters to fetch the relevant subset of data.
Display or process the retrieved data as needed.
Pagination with Hypermedia Metadata
Hypermedia-driven pagination enriches the pagination response with metadata that provides additional information and navigational links. This approach enhances the usability and flexibility of pagination. Here's how to implement pagination with hypermedia metadata:

Along with the paginated data, include metadata such as:
Total number of items in the dataset.
Current page number.
Page size.
Links to the first, last, next, and previous pages (if applicable).
Ensure that the links are dynamically generated based on the current state of the dataset.
Consumers of the API can use the metadata to navigate through the paginated results seamlessly.
Pagination in a Deletion-Resilient Manner
Deletion-resilient pagination involves handling deletions in the dataset gracefully without disrupting the pagination flow. When items are deleted from the dataset, it's crucial to ensure that the pagination logic remains intact. Here's how to implement deletion-resilient pagination:

Use stable identifiers for items in the dataset.
When an item is deleted, update the total item count accordingly.
Adjust the pagination metadata to reflect any changes in the dataset size.
Ensure that deleted items do not affect the pagination sequence or result consistency.
By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to implement effective pagination strategies in your projects. Feel free to refer back to this README whenever you need a refresher on pagination techniques.
