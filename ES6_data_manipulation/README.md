JavaScript Array and Data Structure Utilities
This guide provides an overview of some powerful methods and data structures in JavaScript, including map, filter, and reduce for arrays, as well as Typed Arrays, Set, Map, and WeakMap. These tools can help you write more efficient and readable code.

Array Methods
map
The map method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Usage:

javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
filter
The filter method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

Usage:

javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // [2, 4]
reduce
The reduce method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

Usage:

javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);
console.log(sum); // 10
Typed Arrays
Typed Arrays are array-like objects that provide a mechanism for reading and writing raw binary data in memory buffers. They are useful for handling binary data from Web APIs or to interact with data streams.

Example:

javascript
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);
const int32View = new Int32Array(buffer);

int32View[0] = 42;
console.log(int32View[0]); // 42
Set
A Set is a collection of values where each value must be unique. It is useful for creating arrays with unique values.

Usage:

javascript
const mySet = new Set();
mySet.add(1);
mySet.add(2);
mySet.add(2); // This will not be added again

console.log(mySet.has(1)); // true
console.log(mySet.size); // 2
Map
A Map holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

Usage:

javascript
const myMap = new Map();
myMap.set('key1', 'value1');
myMap.set('key2', 'value2');

console.log(myMap.get('key1')); // 'value1'
console.log(myMap.size); // 2
WeakMap
A WeakMap is similar to a Map but the keys must be objects, and the values are held weakly, meaning they do not prevent garbage collection if there are no other references to the object.

Usage:

javascript
const myWeakMap = new WeakMap();
let obj = {};

myWeakMap.set(obj, 'value');
console.log(myWeakMap.get(obj)); // 'value'

obj = null; // The object can now be garbage collected
By leveraging these array methods and data structures, you can handle complex data manipulation and storage scenarios efficiently in JavaScript.
